# Next-ORPC  
 
 A ready to go Nextjs (Pages Router) and ORPC project starter. I plan to keep this simple for the sake of allowing users to add their own integrations as needed.

## How to run locally

Run:
```
npm link
```
 
Then: 
```
npx setup-project
```
 
Then answer the questions prompted. 

# Roadmap 

- Add App Router template 
- Add more error catching 
- (Maybe) optional integrations like with Auth or others
